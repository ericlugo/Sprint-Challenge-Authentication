# Sprint Challenge: Authentication - Dad Jokes

## Description

In this challenge, you build a real wise-guy application. _Dad jokes_ are all the rage these days. Currently the application is trying to receive some `Dad Jokes`, however we are locked out.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment, please work on it alone. It is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

If the instructions are not clear, please seek support from your TL and Instructor on Slack.

The Minimum Viable Product must be completed in three hours.

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [x] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [x] Add your _Team Lead_ as collaborator on Github.
- [x] Clone your forked version of the Repository.
- [x] Create a new Branch on the clone: git checkout -b `firstName-lastName`.
- [x] Implement the project on this Branch, committing changes regularly.
- [x] Push commits: git push origin `firstName-lastName`.

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [x] Submit a Pull-Request to merge `firstName-lastName` branch into `master` on your fork. **Please don't make Pull Requests against Lambda's repository**.
- [x] Please don't merge your own pull request.
- [x] Add your _Team Lead_ as a Reviewer on the Pull-request
- [ ] Your _Team Lead_ will count the challenge as done by merging the branch into _master_.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and use descriptive messages. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code) and your Team Lead.

## Self-Study/Essay Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager.

- [x] What is the purpose of using _sessions_?

A session is a unit of information which holds the necessary information required to maintain stateful interactions from various page requests.
The idea is that when a user begins interacting with a given system, a session object is created. This object usually contains a session_id, or some other unique identifier, and should not contain user-identifying information. The object is then added to a database upon creation. Then the client is given a cookie which has a key that identifies what session it belongs to. This pair is then used to identify a given user's authentication as the interact with the system.

- [x] What does bcrypt do to help us store passwords in a secure manner.

Bcrypt is a password hashing function. It is used to increase the security of the information being stored in a system by ensuring that passwords are never stored in a plain text format.

- [x] What does bcrypt do to slow down attackers?

Bcrypt hashes a password using a salt. The salt is generated using a set number of rounds given at the time of execution. The higher the rounds, the greater the complexity. This means that a cracker would take exponentially longer computing a given password.

- [x] What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token?

A JWT is built in the format `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz` where **`x`** is the Header, **`y`** is the Payload, and **`z`** is the Signature. The header declares the object type and the hashing algorithm used to generate the token. The payload can also be referred to a the **Claims**. The payload can contain fields and corresponding data meant to identify a session and information about the token's properties. Examples include `exp` which is used to declare a token's expiration, `iat` which is used to declare when the token was issued, and `jti` which is used to denote a unique identifier for the token. The signature is made up of a hash containing the header, the payload, and a secret.

## Minimum Viable Product

Implement an User Authentication System. Hash user's passwords before saving them to the database. Use `JSON Web Tokens` or `Sessions and Cookies` to persist authentication across requests.

- [x] Implement the `register` and `login` functionality inside `/auth/auth-router.js`. A `user` has `username` and `password`. Both properties are required.
- [ ] Implement the `authenticate` middleware inside `/auth/authenticate-middleware.js`.
- [ ] Write a **minimum o 2 tests** per API endpoint. Write more tests if you have time.

**Note**: the database already has the users table, but if you run into issues, the migrations are available.

## Stretch Problem

Build a front end to show the jokes.

- [ ] Add a React client that connects to the API and has pages for `Sign Up`, `Sign In` and showing a list of `Jokes`.
- [ ] Once you have the functionality down, style it!
